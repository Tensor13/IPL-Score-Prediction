# IPL 1st Inning Score Prediction using Machine Learning

 ## Overview
 This project predicts the first-innings total score of IPL matches using regression models. It analyzes ball-by-ball match data from IPL seasons (2008–2017) and applies machine learning techniques to predict the final score based on the game’s progress.

 ## Problem Statement
 Accurately predicting cricket scores is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the game. This project addresses this problem by building a regression-based machine learning model using historical IPL match data. The goal is to assist analysts and teams in forecasting the first-innings score based on ongoing match data
